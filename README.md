# Green together

This is an application to track and record historical CO2 usage by individuals. The first iteration of this project is
designed for the city of Zürich to reduce the overall CO2 emissions generated automobiles traveling through the city.
The objective is toget people to leave their cars at home and use public transportation or alternate means to get to
their destination in and around Zürich. As part of this, individuals must agree to a pledge to reduce CO2 emissions before
they can start using the tracking services.

Additionally, the application will allow the user to compare their results with others in their community and to view the
overall progress of the city in reduciing its emissions. The application allows the user through social media to post their
CO2 reductions and to challenge others to take the pledge. By this method, the pledge is propagated and social media
pressure is employed to get more people to sign up for reducing their emissions.
